## ðŸš§ Package soon to be archived! ðŸš§ 

This package will soon be archived in favor of a relaunch of the [comtradr](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr) package. 

While we are still making changes to comtradr I will keep this package online, because the main function and API to the Goods endpoint of Comtrade is working, but please be aware, that the package might be archived at any time. 


## Installation

You can install the development version of untrader like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github('datapumpernickel/untrader')
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r message=T, example}
library(untrader)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)

## you need to set your API key first
# set_primary_comtrade_key()

exports <- get_comtrade_data(frequency =  'A',
                   commodity_classification = 'HS',
                   commodity_code = c('2204','2203'),
                   flow_direction = 'export',
                   reporter = c("ARG","GBR"),
                   partner = 'world',
                   start_date = "2018",
                   end_date = "2021",
                   verbose = T,
                  process = T)

ggplot(exports) +
  geom_col(aes(
    x = period,
    y = primaryValue / 1000000,
    fill = str_wrap(cmdDesc,30)
  ),
  position = 'dodge') +
  facet_wrap(. ~ reporterDesc) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "HS Code", values = c('#F3B562','#F06060'))+
  ylab("Exports in Million USD") +
  xlab("Year") +
  labs(title = 'Exports of Wine and Beer from Great Britain and Argentina')

str(exports)

```


## Next steps

- [ ] Implement the different modes of transportation and different commodity codes, as well as customCodes and partner2codes

- [ ] Implement access to the services API

- [ ] Include some more links to the UN Comtrade API FAQ.
